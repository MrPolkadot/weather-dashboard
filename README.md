# Weather Dashboard

## Description


This is a webpage to get weather data from the city you search. I used [OpenWeather's](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch the weather data onto my page. The page is useful to be able to see the current weather and the 5-day forecast of the specified city. By using the CDN Bulma, I learned a lot about understanding the importance of documentation and how quick and simple it was to create CSS into my project. Using the **fetch()** method in javascript is a great tool to grab data from an api and choose what data you want to create your own project.


## Usage

Live Page: **https://mrpolkadot.github.io/weather-dashboard/**

Enter a city name and the current weather plus a 5-day forecast will return.

The searched cities will get saved and you can click on them to show that city's weather again.

## Credits

A huge thanks to the [BULMA](https://bulma.io/) css library. I enjoy using it for this project and has become my favorite CDN to use so far!
